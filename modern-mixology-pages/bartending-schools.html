 <h2>The Columbia Bartending Agency and School of Mixology</h2>
 <p>The Columbia School of Mixology has been training bartenders since 1965 and in that time our graduates have gone on to find great success in every level of the business. From bars to clubs to private staffing and catering, you can be sure that a Columbia School of Mixology graduate has worked there.</p>
 <p>One of the few bartending schools in New York to teach you using real alcohol, CBA and SOM believe that learning to make good drinks with flavored water, the common practice at other bartending schools, is like learning to cook with fake foodâ€“it is just not the same! Great bartenders do not simply memorize ingredients, they know what flavors mix well together. Teachers will introduce you to the most popular new and classic drinks and also give you a chance to develop your own palate, providing you are 21 of course.</p>
 <h2>The New York Bartending School</h2>
 <p>The New York Bartending School is the most recognized and largest bartending school in the United States. Our ultra-modern real-bar facilities and 'Modern NYC Bartender School' training will have you working in no time!</p>
 <p>All New York Bartending School instructors are State licensed, professional, experienced and very supportive. They provide our graduates with modern NYC bartending training, the speed skills needed to work in any establishment, plus all the tricks of the trade that will help them advance quickly in their career.</p>
<p>The New York Bartending School, Inc has the reputation of having the most comprehensive bartender training curriculum of any bartending school in America. Students not only learn all the drinks served in today's popular bars & lounges, they learn everything they will ever need to know to become a professional bartender. Comprehensive seminars on spirits, liqueurs, wine and beer (the only bartending school with a real beer tap/keg system), alcohol awareness training, opening/closing procedures, garnish preparation, up selling, customer service. Our affiliation with Digital Dining's premier bar & restaurant 'Point Of Sale' register system allows our students to train and practice on 4 new POS systems at the school - all set up with printers and fake cash for interactive role playing.</p>
