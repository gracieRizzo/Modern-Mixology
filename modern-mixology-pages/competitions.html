David was selected from thousands of contestants overall and eight finalists, he took part in a four-day experience, visiting the Moroccan home of one the Bombay Sapphire botanicals - coriander. The experience culminated with a cocktail competition where each bartender presented a bespoke imaginative cocktail - inspired by the cultural experiences they had experienced throughout the trip.</p>
