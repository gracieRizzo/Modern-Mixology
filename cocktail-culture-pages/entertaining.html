<p>The distilled spirits that we drink today are unique in  some aspect from all of its competitors and many have a culture or history all  their own. The resurgence of the cocktail culture over the past couple decades  has been fueled by the innovations of many of these spirits and the people  behind the scenes. Yet, for all the differences there are many similarities.  Bourbon families like the Beams and Samuels have carried their craft through  generations just like the agave farmers and tequila distillers of Mexico. The  industry is growing and the innovations keep coming, and at the same time, the  past is being revived.</p>
<h2>Toasts for All Occasions</h2>
<p>You have a drink and a few friends, now it's time for a great toast. A long-time tradition, toasting is a bonding experience between everyone involved and can end up being quite memorable. That said, there are a few common mistakes in toasting that can be considered a serious faux pas. Then there are the jokes and drinking games that can always add to a party.</p>
<h3>To Health</h3>
<p align="center">"May you live as long as you like, And have all you like as long as you live."</p>
<h3>To Friendship</h3>
<p align="center">"There are good ships, And there are wood ships, The ships that sail the sea. But the best ships, Are friendships, And may they always be."</p>
<h3>To Love</h3>
<p align="center">"May we kiss whom we please, And please whom we kiss."</p>
<h3>To Happiness</h3>
<p align="center">"May neighbours respect you, Trouble neglect you, The angels protect you, And heaven accept you."<p>
<h3>To Drinking</h3>
<p align="center">"My friends are the best friends. Loyal, willing and able. Now letâ€™s get to drinking! All glasses off the table!"</p>

<h2>Top 5 Drinking Games</h2>
<h3>Beer Pong</h3>
<p>The Olympic sport of drinking games. All you need is a ping pong ball, a ton of plastic cups and a keg, and you've got the ultimate combination of sporting skill and stomach strength. Sink a ball and your opponent has to chug the beer, it's as simple as that. You can't block the shot except on the second bounce, and each team only gets one re-rack per game.</p>
<h3>Kings</h3>
<p>Also known as Circle of Death(COD), Ring of Fire and about a million other names, COD requires just a cup, a deck of cards and some creativity. Spread the deck of cards around a single cup and have players choose from the deck at random. Each card has a different rule decided on by the house that can vary from "Take a drink and go again (Ace)," "Nine Nine Bust a Rhyme (Nine)" and the ever obnoxious "Questions (Queen)."</p>
<p>The only constant rule is that when a player draws a king, they must pour as much (or as little) of their beer into the center cup. The person who draws the fourth king must then chug whatever combination of alcohol the game has produced, ending the game.</p>
<h3>'F' The Dealer</h3>
<p>It's got a different name, but we assume you can figure that part out for yourself. 'F' the dealer is another card-based game that begins with a player holding the deck and asking the person to their left what the top card in the deck is. If the guess is wrong, the dealer then says higher or lower and the player guesses again. If the second guess is wrong than the guesser must drink the difference between the card they guessed and the card they drew. If the guess is correct, than the dealer drinks the card amount and it's on to the next player. After three rounds without a correct guess, the dealer passes the deck to the person to their left and the game begins again.</p>
<h3>The Dude Game</h3>
<p>There are a couple of variations of this one, but for ours all you need are some drinks and a copy of the film "The Big Lebowski." Fans of the movie see where this is going. You watch the movie as a group and drink whenever someone says the word "dude." While that may not seem like a lot at first, most of the crowd should be pretty wrecked by the time the Nihilists show up.</p>
<h3>Flip Cup</h3>
<p>Another game where all you need is cups, beer and friends. Fans of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" will already know the rules, but for the uninitiated, create two teams of equal size and give each player half a beer. When the game starts the team members at the end of the table must chug their beer, set the cup on its top and use their fingers to flip the cup right-side up. What follows is a relay race where each member of the team must finish and flip their cup. The first team to finish wins!</p>
